We have several groups catering to different levels of experience:

- **The Main Ensemble:** Our largest group, performing a broad repertoire.
- **The Sax Quartet:** A smaller, more focused group for advanced players.
- **Training Group:** Perfect for those newer to the saxophone or returning after a break.
