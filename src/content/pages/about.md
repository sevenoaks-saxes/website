Sevenoaks Saxes is a premier community saxophone organisation based in Kent. Comprising both a Saxophone Ensemble and a Saxophone Orchestra, we provide a platform for players of all levels to perform diverse and challenging repertoire in a professional, supportive environment.

## Artistic Leadership

Led by our conductor Caroline Fernandes and supported by our patron, world-renowned saxophonist Andy Scott, Sevenoaks Saxes is dedicated to achieving the highest standards of musicianship. We believe that community music-making should be both intensive and rewarding, pushing our members to reach their full artistic potential.

Our rehearsals, held monthly at The Drive Methodist Church in Sevenoaks, are a masterclass in ensemble playing. We tackle everything from classical transcriptions to contemporary commissions, ensuring a broad and engaging musical experience for our members and audiences alike.

## Our Community

At the core of Sevenoaks Saxes is a vibrant community of passionate musicians. We are more than just a group of players; we are a collaborative space where friendships are formed and the joy of the saxophone is celebrated. From our regular rehearsals to our public concerts and immersive Play Days, we strive to be an integral part of the local arts scene and a home for saxophonists across the region.
