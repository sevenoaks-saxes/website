Our monthly rehearsals are the heartbeat of Sevenoaks Saxes. We spend the morning delving into our core repertoire, focusing on the technical and musical details that define our sound.

New members are welcome to come and observe! If you are interested in joining the ensemble, please get in touch via our contact page so we can arrange a chair and music for you.

## Rehearsal Focus

This month, we'll be concentrating on our upcoming concert repertoire, including:

- **Ensemble:** Refining articulation and dynamics in contemporary works.
- **Orchestra:** Balancing the choir and developing a rich, symphonic texture.
