Our Play Days are a highlight of the Sevenoaks Saxes calendar. These intensive, one-day workshops are designed to bring saxophone enthusiasts from across the region together for a day of immersive music-making. Open to both members and non-members, our Play Days offer a unique opportunity to learn from professional tutors and perform alongside other passionate players.

## Immersive Learning

Each Play Day is centered around a specific musical theme or genre—ranging from Baroque transcriptions to the latest contemporary commissions. Throughout the day, participants work on a curated selection of music, focusing on technical challenges, ensemble skills, and stylistic interpretation. It's a high-energy, focused environment that pushes every player to improve while celebrating the joy of the saxophone.

## Join the Sound

Whether you're a regular member of our ensemble or a saxophonist looking for a new challenge, our Play Days are the perfect way to experience the Sevenoaks Saxes spirit. We provide a supportive atmosphere where you can meet fellow musicians, discover new repertoire, and be part of a massive, multi-part saxophone choir. Check our Events page for details on our next scheduled Play Day and join us for a day of unforgettable music.
