Sevenoaks Saxes is composed of two primary groups, each offering a unique musical experience. We rehearse once a month on Saturdays at The Drive Methodist Church in Sevenoaks, providing an intensive and rewarding environment for our members.

## The Saxophone Ensemble

The Saxophone Ensemble is our core group, bringing together a wide range of saxophonists to perform a diverse and challenging repertoire. From classical transcriptions to contemporary original works, the ensemble explores the full expressive potential of the saxophone family. We pride ourselves on our musical quality and the supportive, collaborative atmosphere that defines every rehearsal.

## The Saxophone Orchestra

Our Saxophone Orchestra provides a larger-scale symphonic experience. By incorporating the full range of saxophones—from the soaring sopranino to the deep resonance of the contrabass—the orchestra achieves a rich, orchestral texture. This group tackles complex arrangements and symphonic works, offering our members the chance to be part of a truly unique and powerful sound.

Both groups are united by a passion for the instrument and a commitment to achieving the highest artistic standards. Whether you're an experienced player or a dedicated amateur, our groups provide a space to grow, learn, and perform at the highest level.
