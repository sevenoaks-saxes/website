Sevenoaks Saxes is more than just an ensemble—it is a vibrant musical community. Based in the heart of Sevenoaks, we bring together players of all ages and backgrounds to explore the incredible versatility of the saxophone.

Whether you are a seasoned performer or returning to your instrument after a break, we provide a professional yet supportive environment to hone your skills and perform challenging, rewarding music.

## Musical Excellence at Our Core

Under the inspired leadership of our conductor, Caroline Fernandes, Sevenoaks Saxes has grown into one of the region's premier community ensembles. We pride ourselves on a high standard of musicianship, tackling a broad and diverse repertoire that spans classical transcriptions, contemporary commissions, and big band jazz.

Our monthly rehearsals are intensive, focused, and immensely rewarding, pushing our members to achieve their artistic best while maintaining the friendly, collaborative spirit that defines our group.

## A Legacy of Passion

Founded with a simple mission to celebrate the saxophone, Sevenoaks Saxes has become a staple of the local arts scene. We believe that music has the power to connect and inspire, and we strive to bring that energy to every performance, workshop, and play day we host.

With the support of our distinguished patron, the world-renowned saxophonist Andy Scott, we continue to evolve, seeking new musical horizons and welcoming new voices into our ensemble.
